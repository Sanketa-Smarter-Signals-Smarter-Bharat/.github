# SANKETA: Smarter Signals for Smarter India
A Comprehensive AI-Based Smart Traffic Management System

Project Report
Executive Summary
Sanketa (Sanskrit: meaning "signal" or "sign") represents a transformative vision for India's traffic management infrastructure. This comprehensive project report details the development, implementation, and deployment strategy for an AI-powered adaptive traffic signal system designed specifically for Indian road conditions and traffic patterns.
India faces unprecedented traffic congestion challenges. According to the TomTom Traffic Index 2024, Indian drivers lose approximately 94 hours annually due to traffic congestion[1]. With over 435,000 road accidents occurring each year and approximately 180 deaths due to ambulance delays in Pakistan alone (similar conditions exist in India)[2], the need for intelligent traffic management has never been more critical.
Sanketa proposes a cost-effective, scalable, and robust AI-based traffic management solution that combines computer vision, RFID technology, and adaptive signal control algorithms to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, improve emergency vehicle response times, and minimize environmental impact. The system is designed to function offline, making it suitable for deployment across diverse Indian cities, including those with limited internet infrastructure.
Key Achievements Expected:
	25-50% reduction in average vehicle delay at intersections
	40-60% faster emergency vehicle response times
	30-45% reduction in fuel consumption at traffic signals
	20-35% decrease in carbon emissions
	Significant improvement in overall traffic flow and road safety
This report presents a detailed analysis of the system architecture, AI algorithms, hardware requirements, implementation roadmap, cost-benefit analysis, and case studies from successful deployments worldwide.
